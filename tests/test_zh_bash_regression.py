"""LEGACY regression pins for bash-side behaviour that has been
broken-then-fixed in the past. Each test names the round where the
bug was introduced and the round where it was caught, and replicates
the production logic inline. If `zh` changes, the inline snippet
here must be updated to match — keep both in sync.

v1.9.2 architecture note: the snippet pattern below is LEGACY. It
caused a six-round review cycle on PR #25 (v1.9.1) because snippet
authors drifted from production without the test failing. New tests
MUST source the production `zh` script via `tests/_bash_runner.py`
and exercise real `cmd_*` functions, not parallel re-implementations.
See `tests/test_zh_production_regression.py` for the canonical
pattern. The existing snippet tests stay (most of them pin pure-jq
projections that have been stable for many rounds and migrating
them in bulk is not worth the churn), but every NEW pin lives in
the production-sourcing file.

The class-3 anti-pattern this file historically exhibited:
parallel-stub-vs-production. Two cases were caught and DELETED in
v1.9.2 (round-7 finding #15 — see the placeholder comments above
their former locations) where the snippet's `exit 1` contradicted
production's post-round-6 `exit 2`. Any future class-3 case should
be deleted, with its production contract pinned by a new test in
test_zh_production_regression.py.

    Scenario: user runs `zh sprint remove "Sprint 1" 42` against a

    mutation succeeds; the post-mutation walker walks the now-empty
    sprint and emits `walked_nums: []`. The guard MUST fall through
    so the user sees "Removed 1/1 issue(s)", NOT "Walker output is
    missing the 'walked_nums' field (internal bug)" + exit 2.

    History:
      - Round-8 #13 designed the jq emit to draw the distinction:
        empty array -> "", missing/non-array -> "__MISSING__". The
        bash guard tested only the sentinel.
      - Round-10 sweep broadened the guard to
        `[[ -z "$x" || "$x" == "__MISSING__" ]]` while patterning a
        defensive check. That re-conflated the legitimate empty-walk
        case with the structural-bug case. Caught by round-11 review.
      - The fix returns the guard to sentinel-only. This test pins
        the empty-array path so a future sweep can't regress it
        without a test failure.

The snippet was a parallel re-implementation of the cmd_set_type gate that ran against its own embedded copy of the production logic — a class of test that pins the snippet's behavior, not the real CLI's, and silently drifts when production changes (same drift problem as round-7 #15). All three branches the snippet exercised are now covered against PRODUCTION cmd_set_type in
    # tests/test_zh_production_regression.py:  * Clean success (exit 0): test_round3_f6_set_type_clean_success_exits_0 * Partial via failedIssues (exit 2): test_structural_guarantee_set_type_exits_2_not_1_on_partial * Partial via githubErrors (exit 2): test_round2_f7_set_type_partial_via_github_errors_only_exits_2 * Hard failure / successCount=0 (exit 1): test_round2_f7_set_type_success_count_zero_exits_1  The production-sourced tests use the `run_zh_with_stubs` harness and stub only the GraphQL layer, leaving the gate logic to be exercised from real cmd_set_type. That is the contract we ship.
