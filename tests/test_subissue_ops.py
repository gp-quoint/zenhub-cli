"""Tests for sub-issue GraphQL operations.

These exercise the same regression cases the v1.5.0 text-contract review
surfaced — titles containing the U+2502 separator, titles containing
the ✓ closed marker, pipeline names containing em-dashes, multi-element
succeeded/failed sets, no-op outcomes, cross-repo children, case-
insensitive repo comparison, and pagination defenses — but against the
direct GraphQL implementation rather than the text-parsing layer.

Every test mocks `RepoContext.query` so no live ZenHub calls are made.
