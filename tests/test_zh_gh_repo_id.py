"""Regression tests for `resolve_gh_repo_id` (v1.9.5).

`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo> --jq '.id'` does not fail safely on its
own. On an HTTP error it either exits non-zero (a well-behaved gh on a
404) or, when a broken PATH / shim resolves a misbehaving gh, exits 0
while printing the JSON error body to stdout, e.g.

    {"message":"Not Found","documentation_url":"...","status":"404"}

The pre-v1.9.5 call sites guarded only with `[[ -z "$gh_id" ]]`, which:

  * misses the body case: the non-numeric blob is non-empty, so it flows
    into the GraphQL `$ghIds: [Int!]!` variable and surfaces as a
    baffling "could not coerce value {...} to Int" cascade, followed by
    a misleading "No workspace found for this repository";
  * and under `set -euo pipefail` the non-zero case dies silently at the
    bare assignment before the guard's message can print.

`resolve_gh_repo_id` fails closed: it checks BOTH the gh exit status and
that the result is purely numeric. These tests drive the REAL helper and
a REAL caller (`get_repo_id`) via the production-sourcing harness.
