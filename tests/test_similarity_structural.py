"""Tests for the structural-relative duplicate downgrade (issue #46).

When bulk-loading a deeply-structured backlog, a child issue's body
legitimately matches the parent that enumerates it (a parent epic whose
body lists "Wave A, Wave B, ..." scores in the 0.70-0.78 range against
the "Wave A" sub-task about to be wired under it). That is not a
duplicate, it is the `addSubIssues` target. `check_duplicate` must
downgrade such a hard match from `block` to `warn` when the matched
issue is the intended `parent` or a caller-declared `related_issues`
sibling, while leaving genuine candidate duplicates blocked.

These tests monkeypatch `similarity.find_similar` so no embedding model
or cache is needed; they exercise only the recommendation / match_kind
logic in `check_duplicate`.
