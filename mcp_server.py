ZenHub MCP server — exposes ZenHub backlog operations via the `zh` CLI.

Read tools return structured data; write tools are explicit verbs for auditability.

    """Create a new ZenHub issue.

    Runs a pre-flight similarity check against existing open issues
    (via the sentence-embedding index, see `zh_similar`). When a
    near-duplicate is detected (cosine similarity above the hard
    threshold), the create is BLOCKED and the candidate matches are
    returned. Pass `confirm_create=True` to override and create
    anyway. Soft matches are surfaced as a warning but don't block.

    configured type works (Bug / Feature / Task at board level, plus
    the planning-panel types Initiative / Project / Epic and Sub-task).
    A type name that is not assignable in the workspace is now a hard
    error (the underlying `zh create` lists the available types) rather
    than a silently-typeless create. Use list_types to discover them.

    Args:
        title: Issue title (required, non-empty).
        body: Issue body / description in Markdown (required, non-empty).
        type: Issue type. Defaults to Task. Discover with list_types.
        pipeline: Target pipeline. Defaults to "Product Backlog".
        labels: Comma-separated label names (optional).
        parent: Optional parent issue number. When > 0 the new issue is
            wired as a sub-issue of that parent (ZenHub-native
            addSubIssues, so it shows up under epic_show / subissue
            reads).
        priority: Optional priority name (resolved case-insensitively
            against the workspace's configured priorities; discover
            surface the bash `--priority` flag exposes. When set, the
            response carries `priority_requested` mirroring the input
            and `priority` reflecting the post-create mutation
            confirmation. Compare the two to detect partial apply.
        repo_path: Optional absolute path of a git checkout to run zh from.
        confirm_create: pass True to bypass the duplicate-check block.
            Use ONLY after reviewing the returned matches and confirming
            the new ticket is genuinely distinct.
        skip_duplicate_check: pass True to skip the pre-flight entirely
            (e.g. when migrating issues in bulk or when the similarity
            index is known to be unavailable). Prefer `confirm_create`
            for one-off overrides.
        related_issues: optional list of issue numbers that are known
            structural relatives of this new issue (e.g. sibling
            sub-issues being created in the same bulk-load). Issue #46:
            a hard similarity match against `parent` or any of these is
            tagged `match_kind="structural_relative"` and downgraded from
            block to warn, so wiring a child under a parent whose body
            enumerates it does not hard-block. `parent` is added to this
            set automatically; pass `related_issues` only for siblings.

    Returns:
        On block: dict with ok=False, blocked=True, duplicate_check (the
            candidate matches and recommendation), and a clear message
            explaining how to override.
        On success: dict with ok=True, partial_applied, number (new issue
            number), url / github_url (GitHub), zenhub_url (ZenHub board),
            type, pipeline, parent, estimate,
            estimate_requested, priority, priority_requested, raw, stderr,
            duplicate_check (informational; may include soft matches).
            partial_applied is True when the issue was created but never
            wired under the requested parent (addSubIssues failed) — a
            parent-wire failure, not a clean success. `estimate_requested`
            mirrors the priority request/applied split. Compare it against `estimate`:

            requested but the setEstimate mutation did not confirm

                "cannot identify which inputs succeeded"; strict
                noop divergence reads "strict no-op despite N
                input(s)"; under-reported fail reads "did not

                `succeeded` is empty because we can't identify

    """Remove one or more issues from a sprint.

    Partial-failure handling: the API returns the sprint's post-
    mutation state. We compare the input numbers against the sprint's
    post-state `sprintIssues`; anything STILL attached after the
    mutation is inferred-failed. For sprints with >100 issues, OR
    when the mutation response omits the target sprint entirely, we
    walk the sprint directly to determine the authoritative post-
    state. Each post-state issue is filtered by repository so a
    sibling repo's same-numbered issue can't mis-classify our
    removal.

    Returns the same shape as `sprint_add_issues`, plus:
      - `inspected_full`: bool — True when we walked every page (or
        the response was complete on its own).
      - `pagination_warning`: str | None — surfaced when the follow-
        up walk bailed defensively (stuck cursor / iteration cap).
      - `response_anomaly`: str | None — surfaced when the mutation
        response omitted or returned an empty `sprints` array, OR
        when the post-state walk only covered part of the sprint
        (in which case `response_anomaly` is extended with a
        coverage note pointing at a re-verification command).

    Coverage semantics: when `inspected_full=False` the outcome is
    DOWNGRADED to `partial` (or `fail` when zero positives
    confirmed). `succeeded` lists ONLY inputs the partial walk
    actually observed AND observed as absent from the post-state
    incorrectly counted as succeeded). `failed` lists inputs the
    walker observed still-attached. Inputs the walker never
    reached are NEITHER succeeded NOR failed — they're un-verified,
    text's count derived from the field (no arithmetic drift).
    Re-verify with `zh sprint show '<name>'`.

    The conservation invariant holds across every return path:
