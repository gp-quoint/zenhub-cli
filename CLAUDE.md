# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code and other AI assistants when working with the ZenHub CLI tool.

## Project Overview

`zh` is a bash-based command-line interface for ZenHub that wraps both the GraphQL and REST APIs. It's designed to be used directly by developers or by AI assistants helping with project management tasks.

## Automated Review Policy

The PR review workflow enforces rules the automated reviewer applies on every pull request:

- **Tests ship with code.** If a PR changes application or library source code in a way that warrants tests (new or changed behavior, bug fixes, new branches or edge cases) and does not add or update corresponding tests, the reviewer flags it as a HIGH-severity finding. Docs-only, README, comments, formatting, and pure-configuration changes (CI YAML, lockfile bumps, asset-only, version bumps) are exempt.
- **Security findings inform the review.** A free, token-free security scan runs before the Claude review and posts its findings as a single sticky PR comment, which the reviewer folds into its analysis. Semgrep (OSS) scans with the `p/python`, `p/bash`, `p/secrets`, and `p/ci` rule packs for source-level, committed-secret, and CI-misconfig detection. The CI workflow's bash + Python syntax checks (`bash -n`, `python -m py_compile`) remain the language linters. This replaces the metered Claude security-review job.
- **Merge gate on HIGH/CRITICAL findings (`review-gate` check).** A two-pass design: the main review labels findings by severity (strict HIGH/CRITICAL bar in its prompt), then a cheap single-purpose `verdict-extract` pass (Haiku) reads that review and emits one machine line (`MERGE-VERDICT-GATE VERDICT=PASS|BLOCK COUNT=N`). The `verdict-extract` pass is an *extractor*, not a second reviewer: it reports the review's own HIGH/CRITICAL count rather than re-judging the diff. The two-pass split exists because a model asked to emit one constrained line on its own is far more reliable than a marker buried at the end of a long review (the in-band-marker approach was tried first and proved flaky). The `review-gate` job parses the extractor's line: `BLOCK` (>=1 HIGH/CRITICAL) fails the check, `PASS` passes it. If the review *or* the extractor doesn't complete (transient throttle) or emits no parseable verdict, the gate reports `INCONCLUSIVE`, which also fails but as a distinct, re-runnable state, so a flaky run never reads as a clean pass. The HIGH/CRITICAL bar is deliberately strict (correctness on a common path, security, data loss, build/release breakage, or a CI Tests failure); style, missing-tests double-counting, and speculative hardening do NOT block. **Override:** a maintainer (write/maintain/admin) applies the `review-ack` label; the gate honors it only when applied at or after the current head commit (a stale ack can't clear a finding on new code). Admin-bypass on branch protection is the emergency break-glass. The gate is **observe-only until `review-gate` is added to the branch's required status checks** (intentional: tune the severity calibration on real PRs first). Note: a PR that edits `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` itself can't be reviewed (the action's token-exfiltration guard rejects a workflow modified vs. the default branch), so it shows review-failed / gate-INCONCLUSIVE; merge it via the other checks + diff review.

zh priority <issue> "High priority"  # Set by name (case-insensitive); errors if not configured
zh priority <issue> clear     # Remove priority

# Planning hierarchy (issue-type + sub-issue model)
# ZenHub removed Legacy Epics and ZenhubEpics in June 2025. An epic is now a
# normal issue whose issue-type is Epic; children are wired via sub-issues.
# Levels: 1 Initiative, 2 Project, 3 Epic (planning panel); 4 Bug/Feature/Task,
# 5 Sub-task (board). Each ZenHub-managed level has a noun with the same surface.
zh epic list                       # List Epic issues
zh epic show <issue#>              # Show the issue + its sub-issues
zh epic create "Title" [-d body] [-l labels] [-p pipeline] [--json|-q]
zh epic update <issue#> [-t "New Title"] [-d "New body"]
zh epic add <parent#> <issue#> [...]    # Attach sub-issues
zh epic remove <parent#> <issue#> [...] # Detach sub-issues
zh epic close <issue#> [comment]   # Close the issue
zh epic reopen <issue#>            # Reopen the issue
zh initiative <sub> / zh project <sub> / zh subtask <sub>  # Same surface, other levels
# To delete an epic, delete the issue: zh delete <issue#> (DANGER, prefer close)

# Sub-issues (the parent/child wiring; epic add is sugar over this)
zh subissue add <parent#> <child#> [...]      # Link issues as sub-issues
zh subissue remove <parent#> <child#> [...]   # Unlink sub-issues
zh subissue list <parent#>                    # List sub-issues of a parent
zh subissue reorder <child#> top|bottom|after <sib#>|before <sib#>
                                              # Reorder among siblings (sibling-anchored, not integer positions)

# Sprints — read
zh sprints [--all]                            # List sprints (● marks active; --all includes closed)
zh sprint <name>                              # Sprint detail + issues
zh sprint current                             # Active sprint
zh sprint                                     # Defaults to current
zh sprint <name> --no-urls                    # Compact output

# Sprints — write
zh sprint add <name> <issue#> [<issue#> ...]    # Add issues to a sprint
zh sprint remove <name> <issue#> [<issue#> ...] # Remove issues from a sprint
zh sa current 42                              # Top-level alias for sprint add
zh sr current 42                              # Top-level alias for sprint remove

# Global flags (peeled off before any subcommand)
zh -r owner/repo <cmd>                        # Target a specific repo
zh -w "Backend Team" <cmd>                    # Target a specific workspace
# Or set ZH_REPO / ZH_WORKSPACE in env or ~/.config/zh/config

# Discovery
zh types                # List assignable issue types (name, level, disposition, source)
zh priorities           # List configured priorities
zh labels               # List labels
zh pipelines            # List pipelines
zh workspaces           # List workspaces (● marks active target)
```

### Important Patterns

1. **Issue numbers**: Can use `#` prefix or not: `zh issue 42` or `zh issue #42`
2. **Pipeline names**: Case-insensitive, partial matching: `zh pipeline todo` matches "TO DO"
3. **Closed issues**: Use `--all` flag to include closed: `zh board --all`
4. **ZenHub URLs**: Shown by default in `mine` and `pipeline`; use `--no-urls` to hide
5. **Multi-repo workspaces**: Output shows repo name for each issue (issues may come from different repos)
6. **Repo / workspace overrides**: `-r owner/repo` and `-w "Name"` work in front of any subcommand. Persist via `ZH_REPO` / `ZH_WORKSPACE` in `~/.config/zh/config`.
7. **GitHub-backed scope**: Issue numbers resolve through GitHub, so issue-level commands target the GitHub issue behind a card. **ZenHub-only cards** (no GitHub issue; shown as `NoOwner/<repo>` with `…/issues/zh/<n>` URLs — e.g. a workspace's seed card) are not reliably addressable — `1` resolves to GitHub #1, not `zh/1`. Direct the user to the ZenHub web UI for those.

## For AI Assistants

### When to Use This Tool

Use `zh` when the user asks about:
- Sprint planning or backlog management
- Moving, prioritizing, or estimating issues
- Creating new tickets/issues
- Checking what's assigned to someone
- Board or pipeline status

### Best Practices

1. **Start with discovery**: Run `zh board` or `zh pipelines` first to understand the workspace
2. **Check before creating**: Run `zh types` and `zh labels` before creating issues
3. **Confirm destructive actions**: Moving issues or changing estimates affects the team
4. **Use full pipeline names**: When moving issues, use exact pipeline names from `zh pipelines`

### Example Workflows

**Creating a bug ticket:**
```bash
# First, discover available options
zh types
zh labels

# Then create with appropriate metadata
zh create "Login fails with special characters" \
  -t Bug \
  -l "bug,frontend" \
  -e 2 \
  -p "TO DO" \
  -b "Users report login failing when password contains & or #"
```

**Sprint planning session:**
```bash
# Get overview
zh board

# Review backlog
zh pipeline "Product Backlog"

# Move items to sprint
zh move 123 "TO DO"
zh move 456 "TO DO"

# Prioritize
zh reorder 123 top
zh reorder 456 1

# Estimate
zh estimate 123 3
zh estimate 456 5
```

**Checking blockers:**
```bash
# View issue to see blocking relationships
zh issue 42
# Output includes "Blocked by: #41" if blocked
```

**Closing completed work:**
```bash
# Close with a multi-line note (preferred for agents)
zh close 123 -r completed -f /tmp/close.md --json

# One-liner comment
zh close 123 "Completed in PR #456"

# Reopen if needed
zh reopen 123 --json
```

Versioning is **VCS-based** (`hatch-vcs`): `zh version` / package metadata come from git tags (`vX.Y.Z` on `main`). Do not hand-edit a version string in `pyproject.toml`.
## Configuration

The tool reads tokens from `~/.config/zh/config`:

```bash
ZH_TOKEN=...        # GraphQL API token (most commands)
ZH_REST_TOKEN=...   # REST API token (unblock command only)
```

### Additional environment variables

`zh` and the MCP server honor these env vars; mirror in sync with the README's env-vars table and `mcp_server.py`'s module docstring.

**CLI**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ZH_REPO` | Default `owner/repo` for `zh` invocations; overridden by `-r owner/repo`. |
| `ZH_WORKSPACE` | Default workspace name; overridden by `-w "Workspace Name"`. Precedence: flag > env / config > git-remote + first-workspace fallback. |
| `ZH_GRAPHQL_CACHE` | Set to `0` to disable on-disk (`diskcache`) GraphQL read caching. L1 in-process memo remains. Mutations never cache and invalidate both levels. |
| `ZH_GRAPHQL_CACHE_TTL` | L2 TTL (`5m` / `300` / `1h`; default `5m`). |
| `ZH_GRAPHQL_CACHE_FORCE` | Set to `1` to skip L2 reads/writes for this process. |
| `ZH_GRAPHQL_CACHE_DIR` | Override L2 directory (default `~/.cache/zh/graphql` or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/zh/graphql`). |

**MCP server**

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ZH_DEFAULT_REPO_PATH` | Default git checkout directory the MCP runs `zh` from when a tool call omits `repo_path`. |
| `ZH_BIN_PATH` | Path to the `zh` bash script (default: peer to `mcp_server.py`). Useful for testing alternate `zh` builds. |
| `ZH_MCP_VENV` | Full absolute path of the venv the MCP server bootstraps and re-execs into. Overrides the XDG default. Empty / whitespace values are warned and ignored; relative paths are rejected. |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | Standard XDG override for the data root. The venv lives at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/zh/venv` (default `~/.local/share/zh/venv`). |
| `ZH_MCP_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | Seconds for the per-launch `import` probe that validates the venv (default 30). Widen on slow media (NFS home, FileVault cold cache) to avoid a probe timeout triggering a needless rebuild. |
| `ZH_MCP_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP` | Test-mode escape hatch. Setting `=1` skips the venv build + execv and substitutes a no-op `FastMCP` stub so the pytest suite can exercise the MCP tool functions without pulling in `mcp` / `torch` / `transformers`. **Never set in production.** |

## Development Notes

- Bash entrypoint + lib/ modules, no build process
- Uses `jq` for JSON processing
- Uses `gh` CLI for GitHub API calls
- GraphQL API at `https://api.zenhub.com/public/graphql`
- REST API at `https://api.zenhub.com/p1/` (deprecated, only used for unblock)

## Error Handling

Common errors and solutions:
- "Not in a git repository": Must run from a git repo with GitHub remote
- "Could not get GitHub repo ID": Ensure `gh auth status` shows authenticated
- "ZenHub API error": Check token validity and repository workspace connection
- "ZenHub can't see this repository..." / `NO_ACCESS`: lapsed ZenHub↔GitHub authorization. ZenHub's GitHub access expires separately from `ZH_TOKEN`, so reads (workspaces, boards) keep working while repo resolution and `create_issue` fail. Sign in at app.zenhub.com and re-authorize GitHub, then retry. (The error message itself now spells this out — `get_repo_id` / `get_workspace_id` emit the guidance, and `zh_graphql` appends a re-auth hint on `NO_ACCESS`.)
